Hi

I created this Redux-Auth App as mentioned in your email.

There is a src Folder with a Components Folder consisting of the route/page wise component folders with JS and Css Files.

I first set up initial frontend to get a clear picture of the flow of the web-app. Then I started with the reducer with only a few things in the Initial State in the beginning, as I moved from one API to another, I started adding more actions, more state in the Initial State. I wrote the action-creator functions first and then decided as to what state and actions are needed in my app. I had a little problem with logging in an already existing user after email verification. I also faced problems with the redux store not updating the state immediately after a dispatch, but I tried to find ways around it.

My code may be a little messy but I was in a hurry to finish the project on time, which didn't happen as planned either.

I used firebase to deploy my app because it is easy to deploy react apps with firebase and I had done it before.
